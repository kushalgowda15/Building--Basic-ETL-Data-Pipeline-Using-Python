# Building-a-Basic-ETL-Data-Pipeline-Using-Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python. The pipeline processes healthcare-related data, performs data analysis, and applies machine learning techniques to derive insights from patient and doctor information.

## ETL Pipeline
- **Extract:** Reads raw data from CSV and JSON files in the `raw_data/` directory.
- **Transform:** Cleans, merges, and enriches the data (e.g., joining patient and doctor info, processing feedback).
- **Load:** Writes the processed data to the `data_warehouse/` directory as CSV files.

The main ETL logic is implemented in `ETL_Pipeline.py`.

## Data Analysis
- `Data_Analysis.py` performs exploratory data analysis and generates visualizations such as:
  - Distribution of treatment and room costs
  - Average patient feedback score over time
  - Types of treatments
- Output plots are saved in the `Output/` directory.

## Machine Learning
- `Machine_Learning.py` applies machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) to the processed data.
- Typical tasks include predicting patient satisfaction or treatment outcomes.
- The script includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and reporting.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required packages (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn):
     ```powershell
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
     ```
2. **Run the ETL Pipeline:**
   ```powershell
   python ETL_Pipeline.py
   ```
3. **Run Data Analysis:**
   ```powershell
   python Data_Analysis.py
   ```
4. **Run Machine Learning:**
   ```powershell
   python Machine_Learning.py
   ```

## Data Sources
- **doctors_info.csv:** Doctor details
- **patient_feedback.json:** Patient feedback data
- **patients_data_with_doctor.csv:** Patient and doctor mapping

## Outputs
- **Processed Data:** Located in `data_warehouse/`
- **Visualizations & Reports:** Located in `Output/`

## Customization
- You can add new raw data files to `raw_data/` and update the ETL scripts to process them.
- Modify analysis or ML scripts to explore new insights or models.
